------------------
To implement object detection capabilities in images, detect specific objects, and send email alerts, you will need to combine a few essential technologies: computer vision (for object detection), email integration, and potentially a cloud infrastructure to store and process images.

Below is a Python code solution using TensorFlow and OpenCV for object detection, integrated with smtplib for sending email alerts. I'll also outline high-level requirements to ensure the system works smoothly, particularly for a quality audit setting.
High-Level Requirements:

    Camera/Photo Quality:
        Ensure good lighting conditions: The accuracy of object detection is significantly impacted by poor lighting. The system should be tested under various light conditions to calibrate the model.
        Use high-resolution images: To accurately detect objects, the images need to be of good quality and resolution.

    Object Detection Model:
        Pre-trained models such as YOLO (You Only Look Once), Faster R-CNN, or MobileNet SSD can be used for detecting common objects.
        TensorFlow, OpenCV, or PyTorch can be used for implementing the model.

    Email Alerts:
        The system should send real-time email alerts when a specific object is detected.
        SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is used for sending email alerts.

    Data Storage:
        Store images in cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage) for easy access and processing.
        Store detected objects' logs in a database for auditing purposes (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).

Python Code Example:

import cv2
import numpy as np
import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText
from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart
from tensorflow.keras.applications.mobilenet_v2 import MobileNetV2
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing import image
from tensorflow.keras.applications.mobilenet_v2 import preprocess_input, decode_predictions

# Load the pre-trained MobileNetV2 model for object detection
model = MobileNetV2(weights='imagenet')

# Define a function to send email alert
def send_email_alert(detected_objects):
    # Set up the SMTP server and login
    sender_email = "your_email@example.com"
    receiver_email = "recipient_email@example.com"
    password = "your_email_password"
    
    # Create the email content
    subject = "Object Detected Alert"
    body = f"Object(s) detected: {', '.join(detected_objects)}"
    
    msg = MIMEMultipart()
    msg['From'] = sender_email
    msg['To'] = receiver_email
    msg['Subject'] = subject
    
    msg.attach(MIMEText(body, 'plain'))
    
    # Connect to the server and send the email
    try:
        with smtplib.SMTP('smtp.example.com', 587) as server:
            server.starttls()
            server.login(sender_email, password)
            text = msg.as_string()
            server.sendmail(sender_email, receiver_email, text)
            print("Email sent successfully!")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to send email: {e}")

# Define a function for object detection in an image
def detect_objects(image_path):
    img = cv2.imread(image_path)
    img_resized = cv2.resize(img, (224, 224))  # Resize image for MobileNetV2 input
    img_array = image.img_to_array(img_resized)  # Convert image to array
    img_array = np.expand_dims(img_array, axis=0)  # Expand dimensions for batch processing
    img_array = preprocess_input(img_array)  # Preprocess for MobileNetV2
    
    # Make predictions
    predictions = model.predict(img_array)
    decoded_predictions = decode_predictions(predictions, top=5)[0]
    
    detected_objects = []
    for i, (imagenet_id, label, score) in enumerate(decoded_predictions):
        print(f"{label}: {score*100:.2f}%")
        if score > 0.6:  # Set a threshold for object detection
            detected_objects.append(label)
    
    return detected_objects

# Example usage
image_path = "path_to_image.jpg"  # Path to the image to analyze
detected_objects = detect_objects(image_path)

if detected_objects:
    send_email_alert(detected_objects)
else:
    print("No significant objects detected.")

Breakdown of the Code:

    Object Detection with MobileNetV2:
        We use MobileNetV2, a lightweight model, for image classification and object detection. Itâ€™s pre-trained on ImageNet, and we decode the predictions using decode_predictions to identify objects with a probability score.
        We use a threshold (score > 0.6) to filter low-confidence predictions.

    Image Processing:
        The image is resized to the appropriate size for the MobileNetV2 model (224x224).
        The image is then processed to the format expected by the MobileNetV2 model using preprocess_input().

    Email Alerts:
        smtplib is used to send email alerts if objects are detected with high confidence.
        The detected objects are passed to the send_email_alert function, which formats an email and sends it to the specified email address.

High-Level Requirements to Get This Working Smoothly:

    Lighting Conditions:
        Ensure that the lighting is appropriate for object detection. In low light conditions, accuracy can significantly degrade. Using external lighting or ensuring proper environmental lighting will improve results.

    Image Quality:
        High-resolution images will help in detecting small or distant objects. Make sure users capture images in good quality with a clear focus.

    Hardware:
        The model requires a device capable of running TensorFlow efficiently. For real-time applications, this would likely need a decent CPU or GPU.

    Model Calibration:
        Depending on the object types you want to detect, you may need to fine-tune the model for specific objects (using transfer learning or custom-trained models).

    Integration with Quality Audit:
        The system should be able to record the detection logs (which objects were detected in which images) into a database to support audits.
        Define clear workflows for how and when the model should be run in the quality audit process.

    Scalability:
        For large-scale image processing (multiple images from different users), consider cloud-based solutions (e.g., AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions) for scalability.

Future Enhancements:

    Real-time detection: Implement real-time object detection using webcam input or live camera feeds.
    Advanced Object Detection: Use models like YOLOv4, Faster R-CNN, or Detectron2 for more complex and accurate object detection.
    Performance Optimization: Use techniques like model quantization or edge devices (Raspberry Pi, Jetson) for faster inference in production environments.

By integrating this object detection system into your quality audit workflow, you can streamline operations, automatically identify issues in images, and instantly alert the team via email for corrective actions.
